## Summary: 

### Of all the models, the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier shows the best performance. It had a balanced accuracy of around 0.93, the highest of all the models by a fairly large margin. It also had the highest precision scores of all the models and highest recall at 0.91 for high risk loans and 0.94 for low risk loans. Therefore, this model performs the best in identifying true positives.
